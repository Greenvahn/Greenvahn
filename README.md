👋 Hi, I’m Saul — a UX Engineer and Product Designer from Spain, currently based in London.

I attended my first computer class when I was seven and and this first computer experience ignited my curiosity about how things work. Since them I started a journey that blends creative design and technical implementation. I hold degrees in Industrial Design and Audio-Visual Communications, and later deepened my technical foundation with a specialization in Computer Arts. 

In my free time, I prototype web apps, experiment with new tools, and explore how emerging tech can elevate user-centered design. Whether I’m sketching flows or shipping components, I’m always optimizing for clarity, usability, and delight.
