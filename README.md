Hello! I’m Saul, software engineer from Spain based in London. I’m into coding, arts, games, philosophy and sports.

I attended my first computer class when I was seven and have always been fascinated by the world of computers, design and arts. After school I completed a degree in Industrial Design and later in Audio-Visual Communications. To deepen my understanding of computer science, I moved to Scotland to study Computer Arts. Since then, I have worked first in multiple roles as digital designer accross Europe to finally land in the UK where I spent working last few years as a software engineer in the field of e-learning.
